                <p>After looking at the MDN website, I learned a few things about HTML that I did not know before. Now in this class was my first time using HTML or coding so I do not have any previous knowledge. One thing that was new to me was the cross-origins section. It was a bit confusing to understand but I think that it would be helpful in relation to loading content that may be from a different page or source. Some of the valid cross-origin attribute tags are <audio>, <img>, and <link>. I learned the cross-origin attribute is supported by the majority of web browsers. Iâ€™m still slightly confused about how it would be used but it is neat to look back at all the ground we have covered and still have to cover.</p>
    
                <p>Some other interesting information I saw on this website was the HTML elements reference page. I think this will be a good source to come back to when I am interested in finding out what a certain tag does. A few tags that I have not seen our used before included dl which is a description list, and abbr which is an abbreviation element. There are many more elements that I saw for the first time so I will be sure to dive deeper and learn some new tags. It was also neat to take a look at the HTML tables that can be created. I learned the tags to get a table started are table then td and tr. Making tables with HTML seems like a long process.</p>
    
                <p>Overall, I think that this was an interesting and informative article. I know that I still have a lot more to learn with HTML. When everything does work together to create a page it is very exciting. I have discovered so much about the internet and how websites are created in just a few weeks.</p>
